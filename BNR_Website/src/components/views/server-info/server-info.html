                Our server is not for the weak of heart. We are all in it to have fun, sometimes that includes getting killed, losing all your stuff, and having to walk 5km to a trader, and dying on the way. That's all part of the fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, while we understand the above, we also realize that sometimes Arma can destroy everything you've worked for. Far more efficiently than the friends and foes you face in our server. When that happens we are happy to help, within reason.

                If you follow the rules below and play with sportsmanship than we will all have great time. If you can't do that, then you will be banned.
